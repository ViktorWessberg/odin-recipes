        <h3> A soft bun with almond pulp and cream </h3> 
        <p>The semla – a small, wheat flour bun, flavoured with cardamom and filled with almond paste and whipped cream – has become something of a carb-packed icon in Sweden.</p>
        <p>The traditions of semla are rooted in fettisdag (Shrove Tuesday, or Fat Tuesday) when the buns were eaten at a last celebratory feast before the Christian fasting period of Lent.</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt the butter and add the milk. Heat to 37°C. </li>
        <li>Crumble the yeast in a bowl and add the cardamom or the orange peel. </li>
        <li>Add the milky liquid and stir until the yeast has melted. Stir in the salt, the sugar and most of the flour, but save some for later. </li>
        <li>Work the dough in a food processor for about 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Let it rise to twice its size in the bowl, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the dough on a floured pastry board and cut into pieces. Roll into buns and place on oven paper or greased baking sheet. Let the buns rise to twice their size, about one hour. </li>
        <li>Brush the buns with egg. Bake in the lower part of the oven, at 225°C for around 8–10 minutes for large buns and 250°C for 5–7 minutes for small. Leave to cool on wire racks. </li>
        <li>Cut off the bun tops. Scoop out the centre of each bun (about 2 tsp) and crumble in a bowl. </li>
        <li>Rough grate the marzipan and mix it with the crumbs and milk into a creamy mass. </li>
        <li>Fill the hollow buns with this mixture. </li>
        <li>Whip the cream and squirt or spoon it over the filling. Place the top on the bun and dust with icing sugar. </li>
        <li>Serve alone with coffee or in a deep bowl with warm milk and ground cinnamon, a hetvägg. </li>
